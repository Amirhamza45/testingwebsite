      <h3>Surobhi Roy <br>President</h3>
      <p>The light certainly shines upon us here at Jack &Jill School. There are so many examples of this in the many accomplishment of our students. Our school achieves the highest academic,sporting and cultural awards on a regular basis during the year . <br>

        Jack & Jill school's continue success is built on several key factors that I would like to briefly share with you. Jack & Jill school is a co-educational High School, a place where students learn together. In ancient times it was Plato, the Greek philosopher, who spoke about how co-education enables the deep development of maturity. He advocated teaching of both the male and female sexes in the same place without showing any discrimination in imparting education. This certainly makes sense.. <br>
        
        At jack & jill school, students matter! The quality of staff at jack & jill school is a significant contributor towards realizing the dreams and aspirations of and for our students. Our staff is committed to doing the hard yards to realise the potential of all students. <br>
        
        Here at Jack & jill school, students are safe to be whoever they are, and to become whoever they will be as they mature intellectually and emotionally. This safety is the basis upon which all students can build their futures. <br>
        
        Finally, my advice when choosing a school for your son or daughter is, consider what Professor John Hattie says, â€œVisit the school on a normal day to meet and talk with the people. <br>
        
        We look forward to meeting you and, on behalf of the Staff and students, may I offer you a very warm welcome to Jack &Jill school.</p>
