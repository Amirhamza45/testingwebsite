      <h1>Preface</h1>
      <p>Time and the world do not stand still, changes are the law of nature and those who look only into the present are sure to miss the future. Today it is a proven fact that education which aims at preparing students for life is a very changing process because when the children reach the age for which they have been preparing the knowledge they have gained proves to be absolute. <br>
        So today's education must aim at not preparing but equipping the child for living.</p>
